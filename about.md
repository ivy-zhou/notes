I'm Ivy Zhou, a graduate of [UW](https://uwaterloo.ca/)'s co-op computer science program as of 2020.
This is my blog, where I archive my old notes and homework from high school, university, and other things I've learned.
I'm also a bit of a literary nut, so there might be few essays and poems strewn in there from time to time. Bear with me.
